    <p>hi! you’re looking wonderful today</p>

<p>we’re going to make the totally unfounded assumption that you wish you did more good in the world.</p>

<p>one awesome way to do that, is to give to charity, but that can be tricky, because it’s hard to remember and know how much to give</p>

<p>we let you set a goal for charitable giving, and then send you friendly reminders and suggestions to help you meet it</p>

<p>awesome, right? we think so too</p>

<p>download our app for <a href="/charico.ipa">iOS</a> and <a href="/android-debug.apk">android</a></p>
